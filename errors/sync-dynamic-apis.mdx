title: Dynamic APIs are Asynchronous

## Why This Warning Occurred

Somewhere in your code you used an API that opts into [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions).

Dynamic APIs are:

- The `params` and `searchParams` props that get provided to pages, layouts, metadata APIs, and route handlers.
- `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, and `headers()` from `next/headers`

In Next 15, these APIs have been made asynchronous. You can read more about this in the Next.js 15 [Upgrade Guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15)

For example, the following code will issue a warning:

```js filename="app/[id]/page.js"
function Page({ params }) {
  // direct access of `params.id`.
  return <p>ID: {params.id}</p>
}
```

This also includes enumerating (e.g. `{...params}`, or `Object.keys(params)`) or iterating over the return
value of these APIs (e.g. `[...headers()]` or `for (const cookie of cookies())`, or explicitly with `cookies()[Symbol.iterator]()`).

In the version of Next.js that issued this warning, access to these properties is still possible directly but will warn.
In future versions, these APIs will be async and direct access will not work as expected.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

The [`next-async-request-api` codemod](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-async-request-api) can fix many of these cases automatically:

```bash
$ npx @next/codemod@canary next-async-request-api .
```

The codemod cannot cover all cases, so you may need to manually adjust some code.

If the warning occured on the Server (e.g. a route handler, or a Server Component),
you must `await` the dynamic API to access its properties:

```js filename="app/[id]/page.js"
function Page({ params }) {
  // asynchronous access of `params.id`.
  const { id } = await params
  return <p>ID: {id}</p>
}
```

If the warning occured in a synchronous component (e.g. a Client component),
you must use `React.use()` to unwrap the Promise first:

```js filename="app/[id]/page.js"
'use client'
import * as React from 'react'

function Page({ params }) {
  // asynchronous access of `params.id`.
  const { id } = React.use(params)
  return <p>ID: {id}</p>
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> You can delay unwrapping the Promise (either with `await` or `React.use`) until you actually need to consume the value.
> This will allow Next.js to statically render more of your page.
